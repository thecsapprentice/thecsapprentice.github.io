<h3> About Me </h3>

<image id="main_portrait" src="images/NMitchell_Portrait.png"/>

<p>I am a graduate student at the <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>, currently five years into my Ph.D program for computer science. My primary academic interests include deformable object simulation, software optimization for heterogenous hardware, and rendering. For the past several years, I have been the lead developer on a <a href="/project_pages/virtual_surgery">virtual surgery project</a>, which aims to provide a virtual authoring and practice tool for plastic surgeons.</p>

<p>My advisor at the University of Wisconsin is <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sifakis">Eftychios Sifakis</a>. Before I began my graduate program, I attended the <a href="http://www.edinboro.edu/academics/schools-and-departments/cshp/departments/mcs/index.html">University of Edinboro</a> in Pennsylvania for my undergraduate degree in computer science. I have also worked with the Math and Computer Science division of Argonne National Labs, where I helped develop software for managing cluster provisioning.</p>

<p>In my personal time, I am an avid enthusiast of board games and tabletop RPGS. I also enjoy baking desserts.</p>
