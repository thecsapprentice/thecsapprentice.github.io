<h2>Virtual Plastic Surgery</h2>

Exploring the idea of bringing together deformable object simulation and plastic surgery is the primary focus of my Ph.D work at the University of Wisconsin. The goals of this project are far reaching, but in short, we aim to provide surgeons a three dimensional authoring environment in which they can craft complex repairs, simulate the potential success of an operation, and record their knowledge of procedures as future resources for education.

<h3>Goals and Challanges</h3>

In more detail, the virtual surgery project has many specific goals in mind:
<ul>
    <li><span>Real Time Simulation</span><p>As a tool for education and experimentation, it is important that the simulation be responsive to the user. While there may be room for slower, more accurate simulations in prediction oriented tasks, during authoring scenarios the tool must respond in real time to a surgeons actions.</p>
    </li>
    <li><span>Arbitrary Incision Support</span><p>It is important that users are not restricted as to how cuts are performed in the virtual tissue. Procedure design is complex and often requires dealing with the geometry of the local skin region on a case by case basis. As such, freeform cutting must be supported to grant the user this needed flexiblity.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
