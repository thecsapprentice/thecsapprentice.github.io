abstract: >-
  Level sets have been established as highly versatile implicit surface 
  representations, with widespread use in graphics applications in- 
  cluding modeling and dynamic simulation. Nevertheless, level sets 
  are often presumed to be limited, compared to explicit meshes, in 
  their ability to represent domains with thin topological features (e.g. 
  narrow slits and gaps) or, even worse, material overlap. Geometries 
  with such features may arise from modeling tools that tolerate oc- 
  casional self-intersections, fracture modeling algorithms that create 
  narrow or zero-width cuts by design, or as transient states in colli- 
  sion processing pipelines for deformable objects. Converting such 
  models to level sets can alter their topology if thin features are not 
  resolved by the grid size. We argue that this ostensible limitation 
  is not an inherent defect of the implicit surface concept, but a col- 
  lateral consequence of the standard Cartesian lattice used to store 
  the level set values. We propose storing signed distance values on a 
  regular hexahedral mesh which can have multiple collocated cubic 
  elements and non-manifold bifurcation to accommodate non-trivial 
  topology. We show how such non-manifold level sets can be sys- 
  tematically generated from convenient alternative geometric rep- 
  resentations. Finally we demonstrate how this representation can 
  facilitate fast and robust treatment of self-collision in simulations 
  of volumetric elastic deformable bodies.
