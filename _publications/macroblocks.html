  We introduce a new numerical approach for the solution of grid-based discretizations of nonlinear elastic models. Our method
  targets  the  linearized  system  of  equations  within  each  iteration  of  the  Newton  method,  and  combines  elements  of  a  direct
  factorization scheme with an iterative Conjugate Gradient method. The goal of our hybrid scheme is to inherit as many of the
  advantages of its constituent approaches, while curtailing several of their respective drawbacks. In particular, our algorithm
  converges in far fewer iterations than Conjugate Gradients, especially for systems with less-than-ideal conditioning. On the
  other hand, our approach largely avoids the storage footprint and memory-bound nature of direct methods, such as sparse
  Cholesky factorization, while offering very direct opportunities for both SIMD and thread-based parallelism. Conceptually, our
  method aggregates a rectangular neighborhood of grid cells (typically a 16x8x8 subgrid) into a composite element that we refer
  to as a “macroblock”. Similar to conventional tetrahedral or hexahedral elements, macroblocks receive nodal inputs
  (e.g., displacements) and compute nodal outputs (e.g., forces). However, this input/output interface now only includes nodes on
  the boundary of the 16x8x8 macroblock; interior nodes are always solved exactly, by means of a direct, highly optimized
  solver. Models built from macroblocks are solved using Conjugate Gradients, which is accelerated due to the reduced number
  of degrees of freedom and improved robustness against poor conditioning thanks to the direct solver within each macroblock.
  We explain how we attain these benefits with just a small increase of the per-iteration cost over the simplest traditional solvers.
