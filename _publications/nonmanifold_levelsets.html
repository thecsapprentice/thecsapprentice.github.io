abstract: >-
  Level sets have been established as highly versatile implicit surface
  representations, with widespread use in graphics applications including
  modeling and dynamic simulation. Nevertheless, level sets
  are often presumed to be limited, compared to explicit meshes, in
  their ability to represent domains with thin topological features (e.g.
  narrow slits and gaps) or, even worse, material overlap. Geometries
  with such features may arise from modeling tools that tolerate occasional
  self-intersections, fracture modeling algorithms that create
  narrow or zero-width cuts by design, or as transient states in collision
  processing pipelines for deformable objects. Converting such
  models to level sets can alter their topology if thin features are not
  resolved by the grid size. We argue that this ostensible limitation
  is not an inherent defect of the implicit surface concept, but a collateral
  consequence of the standard Cartesian lattice used to store
  the level set values. We propose storing signed distance values on a
  regular hexahedral mesh which can have multiple collocated cubic
  elements and non-manifold bifurcation to accommodate non-trivial
  topology. We show how such non-manifold level sets can be systematically
  generated from convenient alternative geometric representations.
  Finally we demonstrate how this representation can
  facilitate fast and robust treatment of self-collision in simulations
  of volumetric elastic deformable bodies.
