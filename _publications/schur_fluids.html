abstract: >-
   We present a scalable parallel solver for the pressure Poisson
   equation in fluids simulation which can accommodate complex irregular
   domains in the order of a billion degrees of freedom, using a single
   server or workstation fitted with GPU or Many-Core accelerators. The
   design of our numerical technique is attuned to the subtleties of
   heterogeneous computing, and allows us to benefit from the high
   memory and compute bandwidth of GPU accelerators even for problems
   that are too large to fit entirely on GPU memory. This is achieved
   via algebraic formulations that adequately increase the density of
   the GPU-hosted computation as to hide the overhead of offloading from
   the CPU, in exchange for accelerated convergence. Our solver follows
   the principles of Domain Decomposition techniques, and is based on
   the Schur complement method for elliptic partial differential
   equations. A large uniform grid is partitioned in non-overlapping
   subdomains, and bandwidth-optimized (GPU or Many-Core) accelerator
   cards are used to efficiently and concurrently solve independent
   Poisson problems on each resulting subdomain. Our novel contributions
   are centered on the careful steps necessary to assemble an accurate
   global solver from these constituent blocks, while avoiding excessive
   communication or dense linear algebra. We ultimately produce a highly
   effective Conjugate Gradients preconditioner, and demonstrate
   scalable and accurate performance on high-resolution simulations of
   water and smoke flow.
