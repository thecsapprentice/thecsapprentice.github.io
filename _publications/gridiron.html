abstract: >-
  We present an interactive simulation framework for authoring
  surgical procedures of soft tissue manipulation using
  physics-based simulation to animate the flesh. This interactive
  authoring tool can be used by clinical educators to craft
  three-dimensional illustrations of the intricate maneuvers involved
  in craniofacial repairs, in contrast to two-dimensional
  sketches and still photographs which are the medium used
  to describe these procedures in the traditional surgical curriculum.
  Our virtual environment also allows surgeons-intraining
  to develop cognitive skills for craniofacial surgery
  by experimenting with different approaches to reconstructive
  challenges, adapting stock techniques to flesh regions
  with nonstandard shape, and reach preliminary predictions
  about the feasibility of a given repair plan. We use a Cartesian
  grid-based embedded discretization of nonlinear elasticity
  to maximize regularity, and expose opportunities for
  aggressive multithreading and SIMD accelerations. Using a
  grid-based approach facilitates performance and scalability,
  but constrains our ability to capture the topology of thin surgical
  incisions. We circumvent this restriction by hybridizing
  the grid-based discretization with an explicit hexahedral
  mesh representation in regions where the embedding mesh
  necessitates overlap or nonmanifold connectivity. Finally, we
  detail how the front-end of our system can run on lightweight
  clients, while the core simulation capability can be hosted on
  a dedicated server and delivered as a network service.
