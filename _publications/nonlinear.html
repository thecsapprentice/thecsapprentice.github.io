abstract: >-
 Lattice deformers are a popular option for modeling the behavior
 of elastic bodies as they avoid the need for conforming mesh gen-
 eration, and their regular structure offers significant opportunities
 for performance optimizations. Our work expands the scope of cur-
 rent lattice-based elastic deformers,  adding support for a number
 of important simulation features.  We accommodate complex non-
 linear, optionally anisotropic materials while using an economical
 one-point quadrature scheme. Our formulation fully accommodates
 near-incompressibility by enforcing accurate nonlinear constraints,
 supports implicit integration for large time steps,  and is not sus-
 ceptible to locking or poor conditioning of the discrete equations.
 Additionally, we increase the accuracy of our solver by employing
 a novel high-order quadrature scheme on lattice cells overlapping
 with the model boundary, which are treated at sub-cell precision.
 Finally, we detail how this accurate boundary treatment can be im-
 plemented at a minimal computational premium over the cost of a
 voxel-accurate discretization.  We demonstrate our method in the
 simulation of complex musculoskeletal human models.
