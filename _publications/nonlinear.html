abstract: >-
 Lattice deformers are a popular option for modeling the behavior
 of elastic bodies as they avoid the need for conforming mesh generation,
 and their regular structure offers significant opportunities
 for performance optimizations. Our work expands the scope of current
 lattice-based elastic deformers,  adding support for a number
 of important simulation features.  We accommodate complex nonlinear,
 optionally anisotropic materials while using an economical
 one-point quadrature scheme. Our formulation fully accommodates
 near-incompressibility by enforcing accurate nonlinear constraints,
 supports implicit integration for large time steps,  and is not susceptible
 to locking or poor conditioning of the discrete equations.
 Additionally, we increase the accuracy of our solver by employing
 a novel high-order quadrature scheme on lattice cells overlapping
 with the model boundary, which are treated at sub-cell precision.
 Finally, we detail how this accurate boundary treatment can be implemented
 at a minimal computational premium over the cost of a
 voxel-accurate discretization.  We demonstrate our method in the
 simulation of complex musculoskeletal human models.
