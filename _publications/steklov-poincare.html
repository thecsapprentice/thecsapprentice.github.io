  We  introduce  a  novel  and  efficient  simulation  technique  for  generating  physics-based  skinning  animations  of
  skeleton-driven characters with full support for collision handling. Although physics-based approaches may use
  a volumetric (e.g. tetrahedral) flesh model, operations such as rendering, collision processing and user manip-
  ulation directly involve only the surface of this mesh. Motivated by this fact we define an elastic model of the
  skin surface which, while directly using only the surface degrees of freedom, exhibits a mechanical response that
  captures the full volumetric flesh behavior. We achieve this unusual result by combining three fundamental con-
  tributions: First, we present a material model which offers a plausible approximation to corotational elasticity at
  significantly reduced cost, by computing local rotations via procedural skinning rather than deriving them from
  the mesh deformation; the result is a force model which is affine on vertex positions, with coefficients dependent
  on the skeletal pose (but not on the deformation). Second, we use this force model to derive a direct mapping be-
  tween surface vertex positions and resulting equilibrium forces on the same boundary vertices, which is a discrete
  version of the Steklov-Poincaré operator of the volumetric elastic model. This mapping is conveniently shown to
  also be affine (with pose-dependent coefficients), but with a dense stiffness matrix which renders direct numerical
  solution impractical. However, as a third and final step we show how a modified Newton iteration and a skinning-
  inspired preconditioner can solve the boundary problem with a competitive runtime cost. We assess the efficacy of
  our solution in simulations of high resolution human flesh models, with full external and self-collision processing.
