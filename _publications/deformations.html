  We present a deformation technique that constructs 2D warps by using spline curves to specify the starting and
  target shapes of selected key contours. We generate a two-dimensional deformation map from these contours by
  simulating a non-linear elastic membrane deforming in accordance with user-specified constraints. Although we
  support and demonstrate elastic models inspired by physical membranes, we highlight a custom material model for
  this specific application, which combines the benefits of harmonic interpolation and area-preserving deformations.
  Our  warps  are  represented  via  a  standard  Cartesian  lattice  and  leverage  the  regularity  of  this  description  to
  enable efficient computation. Specifically, our method resolves the targeting constraints imposed along arbitrarily
  shaped contours with sub-grid cell precision, without requiring an explicit remeshing of the warp lattice around
  the constraint curve. We describe how to obtain a well-conditioned discretization of our membrane model even
  under elaborate constraints and strict area preservation demands, and present a multigrid solver for the efficient
  numerical solution of the deformation problem.
