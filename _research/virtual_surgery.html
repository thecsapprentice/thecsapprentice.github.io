<h2>Virtual Plastic Surgery</h2>

<p>Exploring the idea of bringing together deformable
object simulation and plastic surgery is the
primary focus of my Ph.D work at the University of
Wisconsin. The goals of this project are far
reaching, but in short, we aim to provide surgeons
a three dimensional authoring environment in which
they can craft complex repairs, simulate the
potential success of an operation, and record
their knowledge of procedures as future resources
    for education.</p>

<h3>Goals and Challanges</h3>

In more detail, the virtual surgery project has
many specific goals in mind:
<ul>
    <li><div class="caption">
        <span>Real Time Simulation</span>
        <p>
            As a tool for education and experimentation, it is
            important that the simulation be responsive to
            the user. While there may be room for slower,
            more accurate simulations in prediction
            oriented tasks, during authoring scenarios the
            tool must respond in real time to a surgeons
            actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Complicating this requirement is the
            fact that many common platforms,
            (cellphones, tablets, most desktops)
            simply lack the nessessary
            computational performance to deliver
            accurate simulations under realtime
            constraints. As such, this project is
            also exploring methods of providing
            simulation as a service, relagating
            intensive computational workloads to a
            remote server infrastructure.

        <span>Context-Aware Incision Support</span>
        <p>
            It is important that users are not restricted as
            to how cuts are performed in the virtual
            tissue. Procedure design is complex and often
            requires dealing with the geometry of the
            local skin region on a case by case basis. As
            such, freeform cutting must be supported to
            grant the user this needed flexiblity.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it is insufficient to merely
        cut into a geometric model
        blindly. Anatomical details act as
        important constraints during an operation,
        which trained surgeons use in making
        decisions about their patient's
        operation. As such, any cutting algorithm
        or interface to such must take anatomical
        context into consideration when
        determining aspects such as depth and
        angle of any cut.
        </p>

        <span>Biological modeling</span>
        <p>
            Correctly capturing the biological
        details of the human body is essential to
        surgical simulation. While the obvious
        details include appropriate anatomical
        modeling for geometry, there are other,
        less obvious, considerations that need to
        be made for plastic surgery simulations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with the geometric extents of
        the human body, physically accurate
        material models also must be provided for
        useful simulation. In plastic surgery, one
        common and important task is the closing
        of wounds or holes. Proper limiting of
        tissue elasticity is essential to
        determining if a proposed tissue flap
        created by a surgeon can be successfully
        used to close such wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond the norm, there are then the
        patient specific modeling parameters. From
        extreme geometry due to injury or genetic
        defects, to wildly varying material
        parameters due to a host of factors,
        including age, gender, and ethnicity,
        creating an accurate model that represents
        a single patient can be a incredibly
        complex proposition.
